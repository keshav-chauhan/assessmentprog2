# assessmentprog2
The 2nd assessment of programming module 

In this project, we are analysing a healthcare dataset for appendicitis in children.
This dataset is taken from [UCI ML's Website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/938/regensburg+pediatric+appendicitis), 
and it contains data of pediatric patients (children) admitted with suspected appendicitis admitted with abdominal pain to Childrenâ€™s Hospital St. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany, between 2016 and 2021.
We are considering only one target variable for this project - "Diagnosis" and deleting the columns "Severity" and "Management"

The dataset file is included in the repository. There is no extra file required once you clone this repository.

The packages used in this project are :
openpyxl
missingno
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
scikit-learn
plotly
seaborn

Theres a requirements.txt file which could be used to install the packages via the command :
pip install -r requirements.txt

There's only one file (Jupyter Notebook) called 'assessment2.ipynb' which has all the analysis
The dataset file is named 'app_data.xlsx'
